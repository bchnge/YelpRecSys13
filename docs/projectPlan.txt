Project plan (WITH ASSIGNMENTS)

2013/05/31 <-- yes, we are going to get into the habit of proper date labeling
============================================================================


1. Data processing 
    a. Convert API (json) to Pandas...DONE
    b. merge different datasets (users, businesses, reviews, checkins) together into one master dataset (ALL HANDS ON DECK)
 
 
----- once we get data processing out of the way, we can split up and tackle different problems below. start to think about which you are most interested in working on. Put your name next to anything you are interested in (or possibly interested in)-----


 
2. Exploratory analysis and summary statistics
    a. summary stats (mean, range, plot histograms) of each variable
    b. determine an initial hypothesis list of relevant/predictive user and business variables

3. Modeling framework and potential statistical tools/approaches
    a. build classifiers (random forests, naive bayes, SVM, multilogit)
    b. build cross-validator and error metric comparisons tools (ROC curves and classification error matrices)

4. a more rigorous approach **** if we have time
    a. probablistic approach and mathematical modeling (imagine latent classes for actual user optimism, business quality).    



crossValidation(processed_data)
-------------------------------
Another random sampler of the processed data for the sake of testing potential models. Should be general to the method used to produce comparable error metrics. Will also be useful for optimizing model parameters within approaches.
I have a variation of the CV module already, so this shouldn't be too hard. Also, many packages already include a built-in CV utility, so we might be okay with this already.


===========================================================

We will not be reinventing any wheel. All analytical packages are already pre-built. There should be very little custom work needed aside from initial data processing.


The hardest part will be text analysis. We will use the NLTK package to use text information in a useful way. This means identifying terms that are predictive in some way, which isn't always a programmatic thing to do.

This is categorical prediction (classification). We will use methods that are as simple as naive bayes classification to random forests to maybe even something like SVM or gaussian mixture modeling. (Or combinations of it).

We will have a mathematical model that will motivate our approach. In particular, we will estimate a latent classification of optimistic versus pessimistic versus neutral (mean-reverting) reviewers. That will be an intermediate input into our predictive model for business ratings. I will draft up a general model soon.
